# CryptoClustering-challenge

The analysis is to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their market data using K-means clustering. I am usins two approaches - one is using the original scaled data and the another is using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction. These are the following steps that will be performed.

--Data Preparation

--Prepare the Data

--Find the Best Value for k Using Original Scaled Data

--Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using Original Scaled Data

--Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

--Find the Best Value for k Using PCA Data

--Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using PCA Data

--Analysis and Conclusion and answer questions
